        <h3 class="setup_text"><b>What is QBOX?</b></h3>

        <p class="desc_text">QBOX is like a digital jukebox. One person's device plays a queue of songs/videos chosen
            by a group of people. Anyone with the host's pin code can join their room and add 
            or remove songs from the queue. However, remember that only the host's device plays the songs! 
            QBOX is perfect if you're connected to the AUX and your friends want to put some songs on.</p>

        <h3 class="setup_text"><b>Want to be the host?</b></h3>

        <p class="desc_text">Go ahead and create a room. You will be the host of the room you created, and then you
            can share the pin with your friends!
        </p>

        <h3 class="setup_text"><b>Want to add songs to your friend's queue?</b></h3>

        <p class="desc_text">Ask your friend for the pin. Then you can enter it to join their room!
        </p>
